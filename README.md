# Welcome

Initially, this repo belonged to a talk I gave at TopConf Tallinn 2016. You can find that version in branch attic. The idea was to show a couple of apps that bring a native JavaFX app to Android and iOS using

- native Android
- Gluon Mobile
- Multi-OS Engine

and to reuse as much code as possible. Since then I have updated the sample projects to recent framework versions and made slight changes to the overall structure, for example by adding new frameworks.
